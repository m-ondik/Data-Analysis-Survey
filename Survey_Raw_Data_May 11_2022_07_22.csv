Residents’ insights into the 2019-2020 fire season’s impacts on soil and vegetation, perceptions, and behaviours in NSW, Australia.

Dr. Miriam Muñoz-Rojas, Chief Investigator

 

1. What is the research study about?

You are invited to take part in this research study, which aims to assess the impacts of the 2019-2020 fire season on 1) soil and native vegetation responses, 2) perceptions, and 3) behaviours across New South Wales (NSW). This study is important because it will provide a broad assessment of the fires across a large area in a short amount of time, filling a gap in the current knowledge about the impacts of abnormally severe fires, such as those experienced during the Black Summer, in the Australian landscape. 



We hope to use information we get from this research study to benefit others who may be impacted by fire in the future. This research may promote funding and support for future studies and programs such as the Hotspots Fire Project. Furthermore, by using the knowledge gained from this study, Hotspots can continue to improve their training styles and content and support expansion of workshop delivery efficiently and effectively to meet community needs.



2. Who is conducting this research? 

The study is being carried out by... 

Researchers: Dr. Miriam Muñoz-Rojas, chief investigator, Dr. Mark Ooi, Senior Research Fellow, and Ms. Mercedes Ondik, PhD student, Faculty of Science and School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, UNSW.

Collaborators: The NSW Rural Fire Service and Nature Conservation Council of NSW will send the initial recruitment email to members of the Hotspots Fire project mailing list and will have no further involvement in the research.

Research Funder: This research is being funded by the UNSW Centre for Ecosystem Sciences.



3. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: 

Before you decide to participate in this research study, we need to ensure that it is ok for you to take part.

The research study is looking recruit people who meet the following criteria:

• Over 18 years old 

• A resident of New South Wales 

• Have had direct or indirect experience with the 2019-2020 bushfires

Individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria above are not eligible to participate.



4. Do I have to take part in this research study? 

Participation in any research study is voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw from the study at any stage.



If you decide you want to take part in the research study, you will be asked to:

• Read this information carefully (email research team to ask questions if necessary);

• Complete the online questionnaire.



5. What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved? 

If you decide to take part in the research study, we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask you questions about the impacts of the 2019-2020 fire season on perceptions, behaviours, and soil and native vegetation responses in your community and how these impacts compare to previous fire seasons. It should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.



Additional Costs and Reimbursement: There are no costs associated with participating in this portion of the research project, nor will you be paid. However, if you choose to participate in the interview portion of the study, you may receive a copy of ""Ocean Shores to Desert Dunes: The Native Vegetation of New South Wales and the ACT"" by Professor David A. Keith.



Psychological Distress: You may feel that some of the questions we ask are stressful or upsetting. If you do not wish to answer a question, you may skip it and go to the next question, or you may stop immediately. If you become upset or distressed as a result of your participation in the research project, a number of free contactable support services are included at section 9. Any counselling or support will be provided by qualified staff who are not members of the research team. This counselling will be provided free of charge.



6. What will happen to information about me? 

Completion and submission of the online questionnaire is an indication of your consent. By answering ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Do you consent to participating in this survey?’, you are providing your permission for the research team to collect and use non-identifiable information about you for the research study. This information will be collated into a report which will be provided to the Hotspots Fire Project and a research article that will be published in a scientific journal. You may request a copy of the report and publication at the end of the online survey.



The research team will store the data collected from you for this research project for a minimum of 5 years after the publication of the research results. The information about you will be stored in a non-identifiable format where your identity will be unknown on a UNSW password protected OneDrive only accessible to the approved research investigators.



7. How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are? 

The research team intend to publish and report the results of the research. All Information will be published in a way that will not identify you.



If you would like to receive a copy of the report and publication, you can let the research team know by emailing the team (see contact details in section 9 below) or by providing your preferred contact details when asked at the end of the survey. We will only use your contact details to send you the results of the research.  



8. What if I want to withdraw from the research study? 

If you do consent to participate, you may withdraw at any time. You can do this by closing the questionnaire. If you withdraw from the research, any information that has already been collected will be destroyed. Once you have submitted the questionnaire however, we will not be able to withdraw your responses as the questionnaire is anonymous.



The information you provide is personal information for the purposes of the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW).

Further information on how the University protects personal information is available in the UNSW Privacy Management Plan.



9. What should I do if I have further questions about my involvement in the research study? 

The person you may need to contact will depend on the nature of your query. If you require further information regarding this study or if you have any problems which may be related to your involvement in the study, you can contact the following member/s of the research team:
